Excited to share the success of my recent Credit Card Fraud Detection project!

Key Highlights:

📅 Dataset Details: In a dataset of 284,807 transactions, 492 were identified as fraudulent. Leveraging anonymized, PCA-transformed features, the objective was binary classification: detecting fraudulent (Class 1) or normal (Class 0) transactions.

📊 Class Imbalance Challenge: Class 0 (Normal Transaction) averaged 88.29, and Class 1 (Faulty Transaction) averaged 122.21. Addressing the imbalance of 492 fraudulent transactions out of 284,807 was a significant hurdle.

🔄 Data Transformation: Balanced the dataset by normalizing the distribution across both Class values, achieving a more equitable representation (82.04, 122.21).

Model Development and Tuning:
🧠 Utilized Models: Implemented Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.
🎯 Optimal Results: Achieved superior outcomes through hyperparameter tuning, enhancing model accuracy.

Model Selection:
🚀 Best Algorithm: Logistic Regression
⚙️ Optimal Parameters: C=10
📉 Avoided Overfitting/Underfitting: Ensured balanced model performance on both training and testing data

Model Evaluation:
📊 Precision: 0.92
🔄 Recall: 0.92
📊 F1-Score: 0.92
📊 Accuracy: 0.93

Balanced predictions with 94 true negatives, 89 true positives, 5 false positives, and 9 false negatives.
